# Global Exception Handling Description :
	• Create another package & create a global class annotated with @ControllerAdvice -> That is capable enough to handle our exceptions global
	(In custom exception handling, whether it is service or controller, at the end the parent is controller so all the exceptions are required to be handled at controller level)
	• This global exception handling is more efficient (Not writing several try-catch blocks for each controller methods ) & descriptive than custom exception handling
	• Global exception handling's controller code will reduced as compared to custom exception handling, coz we are not using try-catch, throw ,etc (Repetitive code will reduced)
	• But why custom exception handling, there might be a case that not all controllers are going to handle the same type of exception 
  & if you have something which is common then go for global exception handling
